# PHP Code Example

In this directory there are code examples for pure PHP.

In this repository there code examples for things such as PDO database, classes, methods, and functions. 
I have written a custom PHP OOP MVC framework for school before for example, however it is a bit much
to post and maintain that here. For more PHP OOP MVC examples please see the Laravel en Symfony folders.
