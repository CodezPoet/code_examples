# PHP Code Examples

In this directory there are code examples for PHP.

There are code examples for things such as classes, methods, functions, PDO, queries, algorithms, and switches. 

## PHP MVC 

For PHP MVC examples please see the [Symfony](https://github.com/CodezPoet/code_examples/tree/main/symfony) code example folders. I have written a PHP OOP MVC framework in school fot example (it was a learning experience), however prefer to work with frameworks such as Symfony for things like MVC. If you have a custom framework, I have experience with working with custom frameworks. Please feel free to discuss the possibilities.
