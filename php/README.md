# PHP OOP MVC 

I have written a custom PHP OOP MVC framework for school before for example, however it is a bit much to post and maintain that here. For PHP OOP MVC examples please see the [Laravel](https://github.com/CodezPoet/code_examples/tree/main/laravel) and [Symfony](https://github.com/CodezPoet/code_examples/tree/main/symfony) code example folders.
