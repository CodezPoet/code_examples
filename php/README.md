# PHP Code Example

In this directory there are code examples for pure PHP.

There are code examples for things such as classes and methods. 
I have written a custom PHP OOP MVC framework for school before for example, however it is a bit much
to post and maintain that here. For more PHP OOP MVC examples please see the [Laravel](https://github.com/CodezPoet/code_examples/tree/main/laravel) en [Symfony](https://github.com/CodezPoet/code_examples/tree/main/symfony) repository folders.
