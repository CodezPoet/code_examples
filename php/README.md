# PHP Code Example

In this directory there are code examples for pure PHP.

There are code examples for things such as classes, methods, functions, PDO, queries, algorithms, and switches. 

## PHP OOP MVC 

For PHP OOP MVC examples please see the [Laravel](https://github.com/CodezPoet/code_examples/tree/main/laravel) and [Symfony](https://github.com/CodezPoet/code_examples/tree/main/symfony) code example folders. I have written PHP OOP MVC framework in school for example, however prefer to work with frameworks such as Symfony for things like this. If you have a custom framework, I have experience with working with custom frameworks. Please feel free to discuss the possibilities.

## Something not that there that you want to see?

If there is a certain type of coding example you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities.
May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it.
