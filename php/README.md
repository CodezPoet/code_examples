# PHP Code Example

In this directory there are code examples for PHP.

In this repository are PHP PDO database, classes, methods, and function examples. 
I have written a custom PHP OOP MVC framework for school before for example, however it is a bit much
to post and maintain that here. For PHP OOP MVC examples please see the Laravel en Symfony folders. 


If there is an example you would like to see, to demonstrate my skills, please feel free to contact me to discuss the possibilities. I am happy to learn new code as well.
