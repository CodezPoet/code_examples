# Symfony Code Example

Example of MVC PHP OOP in Symfony framework, Machine Learning, and AI. The code takes content from a WordPress blog (with about 17000 posts) and does analysis using algorhytms for logical phrases with AI. The next step is for the AI answers to be processed to select the most logical phrases for humans.. These results can then be used to automatically classify content on a blog for example. For reading and storing data multiple tables in a database are used using Doctrine and Entity. A cron Command is used to run on regular intervals.
