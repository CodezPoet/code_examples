### View: Monthly overview
An overview of transactions by month. If no month is selected it will default to the current month. Transaction can be by every month, or only per 1 or a few months. The monthly overview will adjust accordingly.
The month menu and month titles are dynamically generated. The total balance for the month calculated in the transactions for the month.
