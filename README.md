# Code Examples 

In this repository there are code examples for job applications.

## Can you code "X" or "Y"?

If there is a certain type of coding example you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities.
May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it. I like to learn things such as code and frameworks, and to keep developing myself.
