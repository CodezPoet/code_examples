## Introduction

This Code Examples repository was started around November 2023. It is meant as a showcase
of examples, for examples issues a developer may run into on a daily basis. The intention is not to put entire code bases or projects here. Often I am not allowed to discuss code of projects publicly, so I have to write code examples from scratch. Which entails figuring out which examples a developer could like to see, writing the code, testing it, commenting it, revisions, etc. There is quite a lot that goes in to it, besides other obligations I have. 

If there is some example of code you would like to see, please contact me first before assuming I don't know how, or to judge me. It is complicated to know what a developer is looking for in a  code example, and I am more than happy to write an example, at the same time, I could spend months writing code, that has no use other than code examples, and that is a bit much too. I am writing this because have noticed this a few times now. Hopefully can find each other in a middle ground. 

## Backend Developer Level: Medior

I have noticed sometimes recruiters or job ads (not mentioning names) are unclear about Developer Level, or pass on the wrong information to a Developer reviewing code, e.g. calling me Senior, when I haven't called myself that, which leads to confusion between a Developer and myself.

Other developers and myself put me on Medior Level at this time, with intent to grow to Senior. 
It depends a bit on the language or framework for example, some things more Junior others more Senior.

## Coding Convention

Different frameworks, cms, and projects can use different coding conventions. Some examples may use different coding conventions, however within each example a consistent coding style was chosen. Currently in the process of updating some examples. In general the following coding conventions are used in the code examples:

- [PHP PSR Coding Standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)
- [.NET C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- [W3C Coding Standards](https://www.w3.org/)
- [Symfony Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html)
- [Laravel Coding Style](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/contributions#coding-style) 
- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/)
  
## Code Examples

### Algorithms and Calculations

Various code examples of C# and PHP, with algorithms and calculations, for example Blood Pressure or BMI, using things such as classes, methods, arrays, functions, loops, and switches. 

### CMS

#### WordPress

Code examples for WordPress like custom plugin, shortcode, and correct text in posts.

### Conversions

Examples how to write from a Excel file to a database for example 

### Database

Examples of SQL (e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, or MS SQL), PDO, Doctrine (DQL and Query Builder), NoSQL MongoDB, and database design

### Design Patterns in C# and PHP

Various Design Patterns in C# or PHP such as Singleton and Factory

### Frameworks MVC

#### Laravel

The code in this folder is a basic Laravel code example for interacting with the WordPress REST API. This to create a Headless WordPress where the frontend can be designed in Laravel, while the backend keeps using WordPress. The output is in HTML with Blade templates.

#### Microsoft .NET Core

Examples of OOP MVC apps in .NET Core, C#, and SQL. First example shows a simple website with jokes database, user registration and login, CRUD and search operations. 

#### Symfony

##### Symfony A. A.I. Content Analysis and Budget Track

a. Example of MVC PHP OOP in Symfony framework. The code takes content from a WordPress blog (with about 17000 posts) and does analysis using algorithms for logical phrases with AI. The next step is for the AI answers to be processed to select the most logical phrases for humans. These results can then be used to automatically classify content on a blog for example. For reading and storing data multiple tables in a database are used using Doctrine and Entity. A cron Command is used to run on regular intervals. 

b. A Budget tracker application made with Symfony and using Bootstrap framework for styling.

## Bugs, Errors, or Feedback

While I do my best to present code examples, when there is a bug or error it is appreciated if you let me know. 
Constructive criticism and feedback is welcome after code review. I like to learn and improve.
