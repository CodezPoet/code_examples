## Code Review Guidelines

"Good fences make good neighbors" Robert Frost

It is my hope that these guidelines can help facilitate code reviews, and provide a fair, balanced, and positive experience.

1. Constructive criticism and feedback is always welcome. I love to learn
2. If you see a bug or mistake, please be so kind to report it, I am happy to fix it. 
I go through code examples with a fine tooth comb, but I make mistakes, and I still learn everyday
3. I know where I am good at coding, and where I need to learn and improve. I am happy to do so, and looking to help each other improve, and where that is encouraged.
4. If after code review you see issues, or where I can learn, if not too much, let me know, I love to improve, and it helps me.
3. It is appreciated if I can see code examples of the developer reviewing my code. I like to know what level a developer is at that is judging my code for a company.
4. I expect a profesional demeanor, and to treat each other as  professionals. Go fanboy and feel superior somewhere else. Period, end of discussion.
5. Just because something isn't in the code example doesn't mean I don't know it, or that I can't learn it. It is hard to decide what code to add, and what not. 
I have tried to make an overview of what code level I am at. At the same time I have other obligations, and there is a limit to what I can do. Sometimes I get
a feeling of "never good enough". Basically: just ask, and happy to look for you and discuss together the possibilities.
7. Just because I do something different than you doesn't mean it is wrong or lesser than the way you code, and vice versa.
In coding, like PHP for example, there can be different ways to do things, all can be valid, more or less. 
I adhere to coding standards like PSR and W3C. If the job has certain requirements or a certain way of doing things, I am happy to discuss.

### C#

C# OOP code example. A console program that shows an user their blood pressure category when they enter their blood pressure.

### PHP

### Screenshots

Directory for screenshots of images used in README.md to show output for example

### SQL

Examples of SQL like database design and queries

### Symfony

#### Symfony A. A.I. Content Analysis

  Example of MVC PHP OOP in Symfony framework. The code takes content from a WordPress blog (with about 17000 posts)     and does analysis using algorhytms for logical phrases with AI. The next step is for the AI answers to be processed to select the most logical phrases for humans. These results can then be used to automatically classify content on a blog for example. For reading and storing data multiple tables in a database are used using Doctrine and Entity. A cron Command is used to run on regular intervals. 


#### Symfony B. Budget Tracker

A Budget tracker application made with Symfony and using Bootstrap framework for styling.

### WordPress

Code examples for WordPress like custom plugin, shortcode, and correct text in posts.

## Can you code "X" or "Y"?

If there is a certain type of coding example you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities.
May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it. I like to learn things such as code and frameworks, and to keep developing myself.
