## Code Review Guidelines

"Good fences make good neighbors" Robert Frost


1.    Constructive criticism and feedback is always welcome. I love to learn
 2.   If you see a bug or mistake, please be so kind to report it if not too much, I am happy to fix it. 
 3.   I know where I am good at coding, and where I need to learn and improve. I am happy to do so, and looking to help each other improve, and where that is encouraged.
4.    It is appreciated if I can see code examples of the developer reviewing my code. I like to know what level a developer is at that is judging my code, for a company.
5.    I expect a profesional demeanor, and to treat each other as professionals. 
6.    Just because something isn't in the code example doesn't mean I don't know it, or that I can't learn it. It is hard to decide what code to add, and what not. At the same time I have other obligations, and there is a limit to what I can do, timewise for example.
7. Just because I do something different than you doesn't mean it is wrong or lesser than the way you code, and vice versa. In coding, like PHP for example, there can be different ways to do things, all can be valid, more or less. I think coding standards like PSR and W3C are important. If the job has certain requirements or a certain way of doing things, I am happy to discuss, why a certain way was chosen, versus the way you work for example. Doesn't mean I am not willing to learn or adjust, just maybe that projects I worked on had a certain way of doing things.
8. "Never good enough", or expect me know everything without investing in me learning: I am not interested, let's not waste each other's time then. I am happy to learn on a job, within reason.

#### Symfony A. A.I. Content Analysis

  Example of MVC PHP OOP in Symfony framework. The code takes content from a WordPress blog (with about 17000 posts)     and does analysis using algorhytms for logical phrases with AI. The next step is for the AI answers to be processed to select the most logical phrases for humans. These results can then be used to automatically classify content on a blog for example. For reading and storing data multiple tables in a database are used using Doctrine and Entity. A cron Command is used to run on regular intervals.

A Budget tracker application made with Symfony and using Bootstrap framework for styling.

### WordPress

## Can you code "X" or "Y"?

If there is a certain type of coding example you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities.
May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it. I like to learn things such as code and frameworks, and to keep developing myself.
