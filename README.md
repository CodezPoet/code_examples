The code in this folder is a basic Laravel code example for interacting with the WordPress REST API. This to create a Headless WordPress where the frontend can be designed in Laravel, while the backend keeps using WordPress. The output is in HTML with Blade templates.

### Symfony

  Example of MVC PHP OOP in Symfony framework. The code takes content from a WordPress blog (with about 17000 posts)     and does analysis using algorhytms for logical phrases with AI. The next step is for the AI answers to be processed to select the most logical phrases for humans. These results can then be used to automatically classify content on a blog for example. For reading and storing data multiple tables in a database are used using Doctrine and Entity. A cron Command is used to run on regular intervals. 

#### Symfony B. Budget Tracker

A Budget tracker application made with Symfony and using Bootstrap framework for styling.

### WordPress

Code examples for WordPress like custom plugin, shortcode, and correct text in posts.

## Can you code "X" or "Y"?

If there is a certain type of coding example you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities.
May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it. I like to learn things such as code and frameworks, and to keep developing myself.

## Bugs/ Errors/Feedback

While I do my best to present code examples, if there is a bug or error it is appreciated if you let me know. 
Constructive criticism and feedback is welcome.
