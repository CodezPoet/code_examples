## Coding Convention

Different frameworks, cms, and projects can use different coding conventions. Some examples may use different coding conventions, however within each example a consistent coding style was chosen. Currently in the process of updating some examples. In general the following coding conventions are used in the code examples:

- [PHP PSR Coding Standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)
- [.NET C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- [W3C Coding Standards](https://www.w3.org/)
- [Symfony Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html)
- [Laravel Coding Style](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/contributions#coding-style) 
- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/)

## Design Principles and Patterns

- [PHP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/php)
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
- [MVC](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller-model)
- [Agile](https://leansixsigmagroep.nl/en/lean-agile-and-six-sigma/what-is-agile/)

## Code Examples

### Database

Examples of SQL, PDO, Doctrine (DQL and Query Builder), and database design

### Laravel

The code in this folder is a basic Laravel code example for interacting with the WordPress REST API. This to create a Headless WordPress where the frontend can be designed in Laravel, while the backend keeps using WordPress. The output is in HTML with Blade templates.

### Microsoft

#### .NET Core

Examples of OOP MVC apps in .NET Core, C#, and SQL. First example shows a simple website with jokes database, user registration and login, CRUD and search operations. 

#### C#

C# OOP code example. A console program that shows an user their blood pressure category when they enter their blood pressure.

### PHP

Examples of PHP code such as classes, methods,  functions, loops, and switches. For PHP MVC please see code examples in Laravel and Symfony.

### Screenshots

Directory for screenshots of images used in README.md to show output for example

### Symfony

#### Symfony A. A.I. Content Analysis

  Example of MVC PHP OOP in Symfony framework. The code takes content from a WordPress blog (with about 17000 posts)     and does analysis using algorithms for logical phrases with AI. The next step is for the AI answers to be processed to select the most logical phrases for humans. These results can then be used to automatically classify content on a blog for example. For reading and storing data multiple tables in a database are used using Doctrine and Entity. A cron Command is used to run on regular intervals. 

#### Symfony B. Budget Tracker

A Budget tracker application made with Symfony and using Bootstrap framework for styling.

### WordPress

Code examples for WordPress like custom plugin, shortcode, and correct text in posts.

## Can you code "X" or "Y"?

If there is a certain type of example for Database, PHP, C#, Symfony, Laravel, or WordPress you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities. May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it. I like to learn things such as code and frameworks, and to keep developing myself.

## Bugs, Errors or Feedback

While I do my best to present code examples, when there is a bug or error it is appreciated if you let me know. 
Constructive criticism and feedback is welcome after code review. I like to learn and improve.
