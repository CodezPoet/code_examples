# Code Examples 

In this repository there are code examples for job applications.

## Can you code "X"?

Tbh, it's tough to decide what and how much to put in the code examples. I have selected code that shows of some of my skills.
If there is a certain type of coding example you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities.
May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it.
