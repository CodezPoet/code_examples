## Some Code Review Rules

After some bad experiences adding some code review rules, if that makes me look negative, so be it,
you don't know some of the crap I have to deal with, and I am fed up with it. 
If these rules means you want to hire someone else: go hire someone else. 
I have a lot of positive experiences but I am sick of some of the crap in this sector. 

1. It is appreciated if I can see code examples of the developer reviewing my code, so that I can see what level they are at, and if their critcism is valid
2. Constructive criticism and feedback is always welcome. I love to learn
3. If you see a bug or mistake, please be so kind to report it, I am happy to fix it. 
I go through code with a fine tooth comb, but I make mistakes, and I still learn everyday
4. I expect a profesional demeanor, and to treat each other as a professionals
5. Just because something isn't in the code example doesn't mean I don't know it. It is hard to decide what code to add, and what not. 
I have tried to make an overview of what code level I am at. At the same time I have other obligations, and there is a limit to what I can do.
Basically: just ask, and happy to look for you and discuss together the possibilities.
6. Just because I do something different than you doesn't mean it is wrong or lesser than the way you code.
In coding, like PHP for example, there can be different ways to do things, all can be valid, more or less. 
I adhere to coding standards like PSR and W3C. If the job has certain requirements I am happy to discuss
7. Open Source at times can be segmented in different groups, I will not tolerate you 
bad mouthing code or frameworks/cms here because you are fanboying and having a colored vision.
8. Being too demanding "Never good enough" there is a weird vibe sometimess, that you will never be good enough. 
9. Learn everything before you start the job. Kinda like 8, while I am fine learning stuff, just because I don't
know a framework or some app or small bit, doesn't mean I am not qualified. But hej good luck finding the sheep with a 10124 legs. 
I am looking for an employer willing to bring me up to speed, and willing to invest where needed. I am doing the same for you. 
10. Open Source developers are used to being scrappy and "scratching our own itch", we take pride in qualitiy of code, are eager, etc. 
Just because someone doesn't have a "classical IT" education doesn't mean they can't be a good coder or whatever. If you look 
down on Open Source developers then why do you even want to hire them?

  Example of MVC PHP OOP in Symfony framework. The code takes content from a WordPress blog (with about 17000 posts)     and does analysis using algorhytms for logical phrases with AI. The next step is for the AI answers to be processed to select the most logical phrases for humans. These results can then be used to automatically classify content on a blog for example. For reading and storing data multiple tables in a database are used using Doctrine and Entity. A cron Command is used to run on regular intervals.

## Can you code "X" or "Y"?

If there is a certain type of coding example you would like to see please contact me to discuss the possibilities.
May well be that I know how, or that I can learn it. I like to learn things such as code and frameworks, and to keep developing myself.
