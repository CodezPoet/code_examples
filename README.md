## Introduction

This Code Examples repository was started around November 2023. It is meant as a showcase
of examples, for examples issues a developer may run into on a daily basis. The intention is not to put entire code bases or projects here. Often I am not allowed to discuss code of projects publicly, so I have to write code examples from scratch. Which entails figuring out which examples a developer could like to see, writing the code, testing it, commenting it, revisions, etc. There is quite a lot that goes in to it, besides other obligations I have. 

If there is some example of code you would like to see, please contact me first before assuming I don't know how, or to judge me. It is complicated to know what a developer is looking for in a  code example, and I am more than happy to write an example, at the same time, I could spend months writing code, that has no use other than code examples, and that is a bit much too. I am writing this because have noticed this a few times now. Hopefully can find each other in a middle ground.

## Coding Convention

Different frameworks, cms, and projects can use different coding conventions. Some examples may use different coding conventions, however within each example a consistent coding style was chosen. Currently in the process of updating some examples. In general the following coding conventions are used in the code examples:

- [PHP PSR Coding Standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)
- [.NET C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- [W3C Coding Standards](https://www.w3.org/)
- [Symfony Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html)
- [Laravel Coding Style](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/contributions#coding-style) 
- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/)

## Bugs, Errors, or Feedback

While I do my best to present code examples, when there is a bug or error it is appreciated if you let me know. 
Constructive criticism and feedback is welcome. It helps me to learn and improve, thank you.
